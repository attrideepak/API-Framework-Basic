1. Difference between @Factory and @DataProvider
Below are the main differences between @Factory and @DataProvider annotaions in TestNG.

@DataProvider – A test method that uses @DataProvider will be executed multiple number of times based on the configuration provided in it.
The test method will be executed using the same instance of the test class to which the test method belongs.
@Factory – A factory will execute all the test methods present inside a test class using separate instances of the class.
TestNG @Factory is used to create instances of test classes dynamically. This is useful if you want to run the test class any number of times.

For example, if you have a test to login to a site and you want to run this test multiple times, then it is easy to use the TestNG factory where you
create multiple instances of test class and run the tests (maybe to test any memory leak issues).

Whereas, @DataProvider is used to provide parameters to a test. If you provide the data provider to a test, the test will be run taking a different
set of values each time. This is useful for a scenario like where you want to login to a site with a different set of username and password each time.
